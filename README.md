- best check startHere.m2 for overview of functionality
- all useful functions are in lib/ and all results in results/
- results/direct/ contains results computed by calculating all vanishing ideals
- results/final/ contains results computed by calculating some ideals and utilizing permutation similarity of the ideals
- results/direct/ and results/final/ contain identical groups of DAGs with identical vanishing ideals (checked by sanityCheckPermus.m2). Both folders are kept to support correctness of permutation code
