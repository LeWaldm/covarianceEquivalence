open questions:
- what is the standard usecase of LSEM? Is it learning the structure or structure given and find the parameters? What if we do one after another? (in the literature there is a lot more emphasis on identifiability than on model identifiability)


MEETING 12.01.:
Questions for roser:
- why do we use the vanishing instead of the conditional independence ideal
- Bug in Macauly2 in graphical models package
- set computational scope
	- do we check every combination of graphs or only some?
	- for 5 nodes as well?
	- any preferences on output?
	- in which programming language should the database access be written
	- is there more computational tasks to do? (what I am doing is only sufficient condition for ME)
		-> this the main idea
	- any idea on how to efficiently explore the data?
	- what kind of statements are we looking to see / proof?
- writing the thesis
	- where should I start explaining: statistics -> cond indep -> Markov properties? -> M_G set -> LSEM -> Gaussian -> parametrisation 
		or just start with LSEM and parametrisation of M_G
	- you want me to include the markov eq iff skeleteon and collidors are the same into the thesis no?
- thesis title: 
	Computational exploration of Markov equivalence with assumption of equal variance groups	

notes:
- l_13 means 1->3
- start checking within equivalence classes
- vanishing ideals are different -> not ME
- ME -> vanishing Ideals 
- vanishing ideals are the same -> ??? (Don't check that)
- Consider any graph in 3 nodes undirected, look within markov equivalence classes
- you can try to compare graphs from different Markov equiv classes
- we want: some special polynomial that identifes the graph
- Markov equivalence is only a property of the graph!!!!!!
- it only make sense to compare the same skeleton!
- try to think about a way to reduce the amount of combinations
- find list of ME classes on the internet
- title: computational exploration of causal discovery with assumption of equal variance partitions
